# Hedera Chat Client (Peer-To-Peer)
This application is a challenge that I set for myself in order to learn the basics of C++, it uses the **ImGUI** framework for the interface and the **Windows** socket library. This software works on a LAN basis and forwarding to the internet can be done with third-party services such as **Hamachi** in order to create a VPN.
# Application Usage
## Issues:
- There is currently an issue where a single message will appear / be sent multiple times. Unfortunately, this issue will never be solved as I no longer have access to the source code of this project due to it being lost after a system wipe.
## Support:
Due to dependancies required, this application can only be used on **Windows**, although, using a tool such as **Wine** may allow usage on **Linux** systems. This is not something that I have tested and so I cannot confirm how viable doing so would be.
## Requirements:
- Winsock Binary
## Summary:
This application does not use any form of encryption and so any sensitive data exchanged via this application is done so at the risk of the user. Further updates for this application have ceased due to loss of the original source code after a system wipe.
